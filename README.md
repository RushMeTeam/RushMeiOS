# RushMeiOS
RushMe is a web and mobile application created to help people interested in fraternities at RPI better organize their schedule and rush event calendars, as well as find the fraternity that fits them best. The project will present users with information about each fraternity, their rush calendar, and allow the user to prioritize the fraternities they would like to rush. Users will be able to produce a compiled calendar of the rush events of all selected houses, which will also be exportable as an ICS file.
