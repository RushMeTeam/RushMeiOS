# An input file for simpleOperators.sh that generates global operators for simple conditions that return Filter and Having clauses.
# This file contains both the operators and the types for conditions with Bool as a type of one of the operands.
# The last entry is ignored.
# The generated code is in Sources/SwiftKuery/FilterAndHaving_GlobalFunctions.swift.

# This is also an input file for testSimpleOperators.sh that generates the tests for the code created by simpleOperators.sh.
# The format is (operator in query creation, Condition case (ignored), SQL operator).
# The generated tests are in TestFilterAndHaving.swift
