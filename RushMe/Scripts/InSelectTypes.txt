# An input file for subqueries.sh that generates extensions for (NOT)IN operator with a subquery.
# This file contains the list of all the types for IN and NOT IN operators (the last three entries are ignored).
# The generated code is in Sources/SwiftKuery/Subqueries_GlobalFunctionsAndExtensions.swift.

# This is also an input file for testSubqueries.sh that generates the tests for the code created by subqueries.sh.
# The first two entries in each line are ignored. The format of the rest of the line is
# (where/having, first operand in Swift, first operand in SQL).
# The generated tests are in TestSubqueries.swift
