# An input file for simpleOperators.sh that generates global operators with Bool operands
# for simple conditions that return Filter and Having clauses.
# This file contains the list of all the types: each line is (Filter/Having, LHS type, RHS type) - the rest is ignored.
# The generated code is in Sources/SwiftKuery/FilterAndHaving_GlobalFunctions.swift.

# This is also an input file for testSimpleOperators.sh that generates the tests for the code created by simpleOperators.sh.
# The first three entries in each line are ignored. The format of the rest of the line is
# (where/having, first operand in Swift, second operand in Swift, first operand in SQL, second operand in SQL).
# The generated tests are in TestFilterAndHaving.swift

# The operators are in FilterAndHavingBoolOperators.txt

Filter ScalarColumnExpression Bool where lcase(t.a) true LCASE(table.a) true
Filter Bool ScalarColumnExpression where false ucase(t.a) false UCASE(table.a)
Filter Column Bool where t.a true table.a true
Filter Bool Column where true t.a true table.a
Having AggregateColumnExpression Bool having first(t.a) true FIRST(table.a) true
Having Bool AggregateColumnExpression having false last(t.a) false LAST(table.a)
Having Column Bool having t.a true table.a true
Having Bool Column having true t.a true table.a
